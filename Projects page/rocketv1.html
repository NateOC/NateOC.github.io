							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>This is my second attempt at building a model rocket from scratch. My first attempt was a bit of a learning experience, 
								but this one turned out much better. I learned more about the physics behind the rocket's flight, including concepts like thrust, drag,
								 and stability. The main thing I needed to change was to shift the center of gravity further up, so that the center of pull was behind it.
								  This was why the first rockets we made spun so crazily, despite a straight launch. I didn't have any mor igniters, so I decided to make my own
								using some matches and exposed wire. I made one fatal mistake, which was deciding to skip a launch rod. This caused immediate failure once we launched
							it, so I couldn't even see if my design had actually improved.</p>
							<h2>Redistributing weight</h2>
							<p>To achieve better stability, I decided to 3D print a new nose cone that was hollow, and could be filled with something heavy to raise the center
								 of gravity. I added a taper to the part of the cone that would go into the body tube, which helped make sure it didn't get stuck once it was on
								  (to let the parachute come out). I designed a separate 3D printed part to plug the bottom of the cone, making sure its contents stayed securely inside.
								The side view of the cone looked like this:</p>

							<h2>Construction</h2>
							<p>I found an A-class engine laying around in a classroom, and decided to use it for this rocket. I designed the body tube to be about 12 inches long, made from PVC.
								I chose to do this because the engines I'm making also chamber in PVC, so I already had the materials laying around.
								The A class engine was relatively small, and didn't fit perfectly into the body.
								To make sure the engine was centered and secure, I laser cut some centering rings and glued them to the engine, then the body tube. 
								The fins were also laser cut from wood, cut into a trapezoidal shape.
							</p>
							<p>To make the igniters, I used some matches, and leftover wires from an arduino project. By scoring the match 
								and securing exposed wire to that mark, I could ignite the match head from a distance using a battery.

							<h2>Launch</h2>
							<p> I was so excited to launch this rocket, and wanted to do it while my friends were back home for college, so I 
								decided it'd probably be fine if I skipped a launch pad/rod. Unfortunately (and unsurprisingly), this caused the rocket to immediately tumble upon launch, 
								failing to gain any altitude. The worst part was that I was unable to see if the design improvements I made did help with stability,
								 as the rocket didn't get a chance to demonstrate its improved flight characteristics. I also forgot to bring enough wire to be far away from
								 the rocket on launch, so it looks pretty sketchy in the video. I squinted plenty for safety. Overall, this project was a great
								 learning experience for how I can be less dependent on purchased goods for my projects, and I'm excited to apply
								what I've learned to future rocket designs. Here's the (unfortunate) launch video:</p>
