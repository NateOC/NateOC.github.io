							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>This was my introduction to model rockets, my friends were making them for a physics project at school.
								They focused on a bottle rocket, using a quark and water for their actual project, but decided
								to buy four E-Class Estes engines for some reason. We scratched together whatever materials we could find
								to make a basic rocket, just so we could see how they flew.
							</p>
							<h2>Build process</h2>
							<p>These rockets were seriously crude, and looking back I don't know how we thought these would work.
								The tube we used was much wider than the engine, so we decided to wrap the engine in thin cardboard
								tubes until it fit snugly in the body. The fins were laser cut from wood, but were poorly attached
								and almost definitely misaligned. The nose cone was made from paper, and taped on. Overall, the construction was very haphazard
								and we didn't pay much attention to detail.
							</p>
							<p>For the third rocket we made, we decided to try out tube fins, because they seemed so impractical,
								but were used in actual rockets. We used some thin cardboard tubes and glued them in place.
							</p>
							<p>These are all the launches:</p>
