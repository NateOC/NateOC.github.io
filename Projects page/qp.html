							<h1>Quarter Pipe</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>This was my first major woodworking project, connecting with my love of skateboarding. I wanted to build a quarter pipe for practicing tricks at home/at school,
								and decided to design and build it myself. I researched different designs and materials, and settled on a simple yet sturdy structure using plywood and two by fours.
								The school had a lot of two by fours laying around, so I was able to build this pretty affordably.
								The process involved sketching the height and transition I wanted on the ramp, then
								 measuring and cutting the wood, assembling the frame, and attaching the plywood surface. 
								 It was a challenging but rewarding experience, that took much longer than I expected.
								I learned a lot about woodworking techniques and safety along the way.
							</p>

							<h2>Making the Frame</h2>
							<p>I spent a good amount of time thinking about the transition, cause I wanted the ramp to get close to vert (vertical)
								 but still be reasonably small so I could learn new tricks on it. I decided on a 4-foot tall, 6-foot wide quarter pipe that had a rib cage like frame.
								 I sketched out the design on graph paper to help visualize the dimensions and shape. Once I had the design finalized, I gathered the materials I needed,
								 and started by cutting the two by fours to the appropriate lengths. I then scaled my sketch of the transition up,
								 and drew it onto the plywood sheets to use as a cutting guide. After cutting out the transition with a jigsaw, I cut
								 knotches out of the middle sheet of plywood, that the two by fours would fit into. This added support in multiple
								 directions, and I even added some diagonal bracing on the middle piece to stop it from flexing. Next,
								 I assembled the frame using screws to attach the two by fours to the plywood sheets. At this stage, the ramp looked
								 like this:

							<h2>Adding the Surface and Coping</h2>
							<p> 
								With the frame complete, I moved on to attaching the plywood surface. I decided to use 1/4" marine plywood for 
								the surface, combining flexibility and strength. Conveniently, the length of the ramp's transition was exactly 8ft, so
								I could use the full length of the plywood sheets without needing to cut them down. I 
								did have to cut one sheet in half, to cover the width of the ramp. 
								I carefully aligned the plywood sheets on top of the frame, ensuring that they were flush with the edges, and screwed them into
								the two by fours underneath. I made sure to space the screws evenly to provide a secure attachment while avoiding splitting the plywood.
								Once the plywood surface was securely attached, I used wood putty to cover the screws, making sure the ramp had a smooth
								surface. Next, I added coping to the top edge of the ramp. Coping is a metal pipe that provides a smooth edge for grinding and lip tricks.
								I measured and cut a length of metal pipe to fit the width of the ramp, but realized I didn't have anywhere to attach the coping.
								I added two extra two by fours to the top of the ramp, one on the front and one on the back, to give the coping something to be screwed into.
								I drilled holes through the coping and into the wooden supports, then secured it with screws and washers to ensure a tight fit.
								Here is the ramp with the surface and coping added (the lip is a little warped in this picture, but I eventually fixed it):

							<h2>Takeaways</h2>
							<p>Overall, building this quarter pipe was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about woodworking techniques,
								safety, and problem-solving throughout the process. The ramp quickly became a source of pride and enjoyment for me,
								and I'm glad I put the time and effort into building it. This project is what inspired me to take on more woodworking projects in the future.
