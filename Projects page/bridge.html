							<h1>Trail Bridge</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="/Projects page/pimages/bridgebg.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>This was a fun project my friend was doing as part of becoming an Eagle Scout. He was re-opening a trail, and closing off a new one in the Fells Reservation.
								On the trail, there was a stream and a big muddy patch that obstructed the path. He decided to build a bridge over the stream, and take the
								bridge from the old trail and put it over the muddy patch. A big part of this project was the labor: carrying out all the tools and materials 
								needed to build the bridge, and moving the old bridge to the new location. We went with a simple design, very similar to the bridge on the old trail.
							</p>
							<h2>Clearing the Area</h2>
							<p>Before we could build the bridge, we had to clear the trail of any debris and obstacles. This involved removing rocks, branches, and other materials that could
								get in the way. The path to where the bridge was built has a ton of sharp turns that made it really hard to transport the beams and the old bridge.
							Nevertheless, we persevered.</p>

							<h2>The Process:</h2>

											<h3 class="major"> Carrying the beams</h3>
											<p>This is use at the very start of the trail, carrying these huge beams that will lay across the stream for the bridge. The boards that will
												go across are visible too, laying on the ground. It was about a mile to the stream from here, carrying these heavy beams.

											<h3 class="major">Starting the Frame</h3>
											<p>This was on the other side of the stream, after we had carried everything over. The beams were predrilled to allow for easier assembly
												once we had arrived. You can see us starting to put the frame together here, bolting the beams to the supports.

											<h3 class="major">Moving the Frame</h3>
											<p>Once the frame was complete we laid it across the stream, making sure it was properly aligned and secure. This took a 
												lot of teamwork, as the frame was heavy and unwieldy. We had to carefully bring it over the stream, making sure not
											to drop it and that nobody fell in in the process.

											<h3 class="major">Adding the Deck</h3>
											<p>At this point, we were basically done and just had to screw in the deck boards. This part was pretty straightforward, just making sure everything was aligned
												and secure. Quick note: we didn't take any pictures of us moving the old bridge because of how heavy it was. The boards were
												soaked, adding a ton of weight, and the old path was even more treacherous than the new one. It was an all hands on deck situation,
												and we just focused on getting it done quickly.

							<h2>What I Gained</h2>
							<p> This was a great opportunity to get outside and do some physical labor for a good cause. It was a ton of fun to be back to building, as I hadn't
								had access to tools and materials like this in a while. It also felt great to contribute to something that would be used
								by so many people, and I learned a lot about teamwork and problem solving. Moving all the materials through the rough terrain was definitely
								a challenge, but we managed to get everything done. Getting all of us on the bridge at the end was a great moment, and made it all 
								feel even more worth it. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that I won't forget.
