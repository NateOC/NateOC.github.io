							<h1>One-Sheet Boat</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>
								Building a one-sheet boat was an exciting challenge that combined my interests in woodworking and the outdoors.
								The idea of constructing a functional boat from a single sheet of marine plywood intrigued me, as it required careful planning and precise execution.
								I started by researching different boat designs that could be built using just one sheet of plywood. After selecting a simple yet effective design,
								 I created detailed plans and measurements to guide the construction process.
							</p>

							<h2>Drawing the Plans</h2>
							<p>I wanted my boat to be unique, and not the standard canoe that you typically see with this style of construction.
								 I decided to add a transom at the back, giving it a more classic look, and giving me more room inside the boat.
								 I drew out the plans on graph paper, making sure to include all necessary measurements and angles for cutting the plywood:

									<h3>Side Sketches</h3>
									<p>These are my side sketches, using a table to scale the dimensions accurately. Before we did
										anything with wood, we made paper models of the boat to make sure the dimensions worked out,
										and that we liked the actual shape. This is where the table came in handy, helping us quickly
										scale the dimensions of the boat at different points along its length, using the offset from
										the centerline. I made the back of the boat less inclined that the front to accomodate the
										transom. When I was making this, I also considered that the back would be lower to the water, so I wanted some extra height
										to keep water out. But now, looking back on it, the angle didn't change the height at all;
										if anything, more of an incline would be better at keeping water out as there would be more
										surface area. The change I made was small enough not to be a problem though, staying in the 
										12-15 degree range that is typical for boats of this style.

									<h3>Bottom Dimensions</h3>
									<p>This is the sketch of the bottom dimensions, you can see how much space the transom adds to the boat. This is because 
										I don't have to worry about tapering the back as much, and can make the center frame very wide. I did this because I 
										wanted to have more room in the boat for gear and passengers, and especially for fishing.

									<h3>Complete Sketch</h3>
									<p>This is the final sketch of my boat's parts, showing how everything fits together on one sheet of plywood.
										Next, I transferred these plans onto the plywood, carefully measuring and marking each piece before cutting.

							<h2>Cutting and Assembly</h2>
							<p>
								With the plans drawn out, I proceeded to cut the plywood according to the measurements. I did this using a jig saw on the curved sections and a circular saw for straight cuts.
								The assembly process was quite difficult, because it had to be done in stages while bending the wood.
								I started by attaching the sides to the stem, which was cut to the correct angle to match the boat's curvature.
								Once the sides were securely attached, sticking off sideways, I added the center frame. The center frame provided structural support and helped maintain the boat's shape.
								It acted as a checkpoint for bending the sides correctly, ensuring that there wasn't too much stress on the wood as I worked down the length of the boat.
								Then I added the transom at the back, which was a bit tricky due to the angles involved, but it added a nice touch to the overall design, and led to the next step.
								With the frame of the boat complete, I added the bottom panel. This part requierd tons of clamps to make sure it stayed in place while I secured it to the sides and center frame.
								To do this, I added wood framing the the bottom and top of the side pantels, giving them strength and also a place to nail the bottom panel into.
								I added caulking to all the seams before clamping the bottom panel in place, and then using brass nails to secure it.
								It stayed drying like this for a while, before I did a final check of all the seems, using caulking to fill in any gaps I found.
								At this stage, this is what the boat looked like:

							<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
							<p>Next, I added two seats to the boat for comfort while paddling. I also installed oar locks on either side, allowing for easy rowing.
								To protect the plywood's longevity, I applied several coats of paint, ensuring the boat would be durable and also look nice (I love the look of plain wood though).
								Now I just had to take it out on the water.
