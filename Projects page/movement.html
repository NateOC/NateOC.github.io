							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>I remember always hearing people talking about how efficient C# is, and that its the best coding language. I had also seen it in action
								on the Unity editor a while back, when a friend of mine was messing around with VR. I wanted to be able to create something similar, so 
								I started learning C# and Unity myself. I thought the most engaging way of doing this would be to create first person movement in the 
							Unity editor because I've always enjoyed first person games, but never knew what was involved in making them.</p>
							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>I had zero knowledge of C#, outside of general coding knowledge I had accumulated over the years. I started with the basics, 
								learning about variables, data types, and control structures. As I became more comfortable with the language, I began to explore 
								Unity's features and how they could be used to create immersive experiences. I worked in three files: MoveCamera.cs, PlayerCam.cs, and 
								PlayerMovement.cs. They defined how the camera was controlled, defined the actual camera properties, and defined how the player moved respectively.
								I had to learn about Unity's input system, physics engine, and how to manipulate game objects through code. It was a challenging process, 
								but I found it incredibly rewarding to see my code come to life in the Unity editor. I had the help of several tutorials,
								which made the process much easier to understand.
							</p>
							<h2>The Result</h2>

							<p>The end result is a functional first person movement system in Unity, as shown above. I added some platforms and 
								obstacles to demonstrate the movement capabilities. The player can move around using the WASD keys and look around using the mouse.
								I also implemented jumping and climbing mechanics, allowing the player to navigate vertical spaces. Overall, this project was a great learning experience,
								and I'm glad I took the time to learn C#.
