							<h1>Making Model Rocket Engines</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="pimages/ening.png" alt=""/></span>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>After looking deeper into model rockets, and becoming more independent in my construction,
								I realized I should be making my own engines. The chemistry was simple enough, all I needed
								was a fuel (sorbitol) and an oxidizer (Potassium Nitrate). I looked into ways to improve this fuel as well,
								 like adding iron oxide to make it burn more quickly, or glycerol to make the mixture easier to pour. I haven't
								tried these additives yet, but I plan to in the very near future.
									I talked with my former chemistry
								teacher to see what materials he had, and he was able to provide me with Potassium Nitrate and a safe
								lab space to work in. I ordered
								sorbitol online, and got to work.</p>
							
							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>The first step was to grind the Potassium Nitrate and the sorbitol into a fine powder, and 
								then mix them together at a 65:35 ratio. My research showed me that sorbitol was best because
							it melted at such a low temperature, and I wouldn't have to worry about caramelization like with
						regular sugar.</p>
							<p>Once I had the powder mixed in a beaker (this was a small test batch), I placed it on a hot
								plate and heated it to about 150 degrees Celsius. The sorbitol melted and combined with the Potassium Nitrate
								to form a thick, white paste. I stirred it constantly to ensure an even consistency.
							</p>
							<p>Once the mixture was ready, I poured it onto a piece of tin foil for testing.</p>

											<h3>Stirring the Mixture</h3>
											<p>This is what my setup looked like: using a hot plate and a popsicle stick to stir so there's no risk of sparks.
												 I sat stirring like this for a while. I didn't want to heat
												it too quickly. I made sure to be extra safe, wearing gloves and goggles at all times.

											<p>This is a picture of the fuel mixture after it was poured onto the tin foil.
												 Once it cooled down it took on a much more white color and a firm texture.
												 Even just after pouring, I could feel it solidifying quickly.

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>This is still a work in progress, and I haven't launched any of the engines I've made yet. For now,
								I just have a video of the fuel burning on the tin foil. It burned with a steady flame, and produced a
								ton of smoke. I'm excited to try this fuel in an actual engine casing soon, and try adding
								iron oxide to speed up the burn.

							<h2>Next Steps</h2>
							<p>My next steps are to try adding additives to the fuel mixture, and see how they affect the burn rate and thrust.
								I also need to design and build some engine casings to hold the fuel, and test them in actual launches.
								I want to add nozzles to the engines, using one of the CNC machines at school to make them, improving thrust. I would most likely make these
								out of aluminum, as that is what we have in class, but I fear this may be too heavy.
								I'll document my progress here as I continue to experiment.
