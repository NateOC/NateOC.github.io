							<h1>Hand Carved Fishing Lures</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Fishing is one of my favorite outdoor activities, and when I realized I could carve my own lures, I had to try it.
								Hand carving fishing lures allowed me to combine my love for fishing with my passion for woodworking and creativity.
								I made two kinds of lures: crankbaits and glidebaits. The glidebaits were tough because they
								are meant to "swim" through the water, requiring a more complex shape and weight distribution.
								Each lure took a significant amount of time and effort to create, but the satisfaction of catching 
								fish with something I made myself is unparalleled. Quick note: I'm working on getting pictures of the final products, I never took any during the project, 
								and I somehow lost the tacklebox that had the lures.

							</p>

							<h2>Finding Materials</h2>
							<p> After some quick research, I learned that cedar wood is the most common material
								for hand carving fishing lures. Cedar is lightweight, buoyant, and easy to carve, making it ideal for creating lures.
								I had to order wire to create the eyes of the lure (where the line and hooks are attached), as well as hooks and split rings.
								With all the materials gathered, I was ready to start carving my lures.
							</p>

							<h2>Carving the Lures</h2>
							<p> I began by sketching out the designs for my lures on paper, considering the shape, size, and color patterns I wanted to achieve.
								Using a bandsaw, I cut the cedar wood into rough blocks that matched the general shape of my designs.
								Next, I used carving knives to refine the shape of the lures, carefully shaping them.
								I paid close attention to details like the placement of the eyes and the overall symmetry of the lures.
							</p>
							<p>Once I had the shape I wanted, I drilled holes wherever I wanted to place an eye. I then bent some wire into shape, 
								twisting its ends and securing them into the lure using epoxy.</p>	
							

							<h2>Adding features - Crankbaits</h2>
							<p> 
								I somehow have no pictures of my final products, which really sucks. The next step for the crankbaits was to add the lip;
								I cut a notch into the front of the lure, and attached a lip I ordered online using epoxy. Then, after sanding the lures
								to a smooth finish, I applied several coats of paint by hand to achieve the desired color patterns. After the paint and  dried, I applied
								a clear coat to protect the finish and give the lures a glossy appearance. 
								Finally, I attached the hooks to the lures using split rings, ensuring they were securely fastened and ready for fishing.

									<p>These are my crankbait iterations, showcasing the improvement of my design from the first attempt. I'll hopefully have pictures of the final products soon.</p>
								</article>
								
							</section>

							<h2>Adding features - Glidebaits</h2>
							<p>The glidebaits were a little more complicated, because they are meant to either stay suspended in the water, or sink slowly.
								I had to add weight to the lures to achieve this. I carved out small cavities in the belly of the lure using a drill, and filled them with
								lead that I melted down from old fishing weights. After the lead cooled and hardened, I sealed the cavities with epoxy to prevent water from entering.
								It took a lot of trial and error to get the weight distribution right, but after testing them in a tub of water, I was able to achieve the desired buoyancy and swimming action.
								I then painted and finished them, following the same process as the crank baits, except I used spray paint for a more simple pattern, and added plastic eyes for a more realistic look.
							</p>

							<p>There'll hopefully be some pictures of the glidebaits soon.</p>
