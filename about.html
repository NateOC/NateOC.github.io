									<h3 class="major">Getting Outdoors</h3>
									<p>I love to fish, swim, and spend time in nature. A big part of this is spending time with my friends. 
										Of these activities, fishing is my favorite. I loved it when I was really young (3-5 years old) but 
										stopped as time passed. I picked it back up in middle school, when I had a ton of free time, and fell 
										back in love with it. I invested a ton of time and effort into improving my skills and learning new 
										techniques. I was terribly unsuccessful, and still am, but nevertheless I loved it; it was so peaceful, 
										and took much more focus than one would expect. The best part was the spots: its best to fish in a quiet 
										place, away from the noise and distractions of everyday life; getting to a spot normally involved a hike 
										through the woods. This only added to the fun of fishing, blossoming my love for nature. Today, I get out
										 whenever I can, and have learned to appreciate all the details of the outdoors and natural life. I'm hoping
										to pick up camping as well, the idea of waking up in the morning and being surrounded by nature, and especially mountains,
									sounds really cool.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Cliff Jumping</h3>
									<p>Cliff jumping is one of the most significant of my activities, because of the lessons I've learned 
										from it. Before I started cliff jumping, I was a pretty shy and reserved person, and lived my life
										constantly in fear. I didn't like taking risks: whether I was simply talking to new people, or trying
										something new, I was always held back by my fear of failure. Cliff jumping changed all that. I learned
										to count down from three, and no matter what, jump when I hit one. This simple technique helped me
										push past my fear, and taught me that the only way to grow is to take risks. Since then, I've applied
										this lesson to many other areas of my life, and have become a much more confident and outgoing person.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Other Activities</h3>
									<p>I've learned to find fun in all things, and in trying new things. I've been playing volleyball
										for a few years now, and really enjoy it. I've also recently started snowboarding, which I find
										super fun. I've always loved video games, especially because it's a way to connect with friends that live far.
										Anything that gets me outside or active, I'm down to try. I was in Michigan
										with my friends, where I had a ton of fun wakeboarding and tubing on the lake; this was
										my first time trying either, and I loved it. I got much more into outdoor volleyball
										this summer, playing at the beach and in parks with my friends in tournaments. Outside of being
										active and with friends, I love to cook and bake. My mom has been a huge influence on this, inspiring me and
										teaching me how to make many different dishes and desserts. I don't spend as much time in the kitchen as I used to, but I
										 still love taking any opportunity to learn new recipes and techniques.

											<h3>Ragged Mountain</h3>
											<p>The snow was so deep in places, it was crazy. The edges of the trails were so
												soft that we would just sink into them if we weren't careful. I'd never been
												in so much snow, and it was a ton of fun.

											<h3>Grass Volleyball</h3>
											<p>I played a ton of outdoor volleyball this summer, and played
												in grass tournaments for the first time. It was a super fun environment,
												and I really enjoyed being outside with my friends. I picked up
												beach volleyball as well, but I don't have any film from that.

											<h3>New Hampshire Quarry</h3>
											<p>This was my first time back to cliff jumping after rupturing my eardrum, 
												and I had just bought a trampoline so was super excited to try 
												it out. I underrotated on purpose so I didn't go too deep in the water,
												my ear still hadn't fully healed.
