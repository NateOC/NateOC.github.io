									<h3 class="major">Getting Outdoors</h3>
									<p>I love to fish, swim, and spend time in nature. A big part of this is spending time with my friends. Of these activities, fishing is my favorite. I loved it when I was really young (3-5 years old) but stopped as time passed. I picked it back up in middle school, when I had a ton of free time, and fell back in love with it. I invested a ton of time and effort into improving my skills and learning new techniques. I was terribly unsuccessful, and still am, but nevertheless I loved it; it was so peaceful, and took much more focus than one would expect. The best part was the spots: its best to fish in a quiet place, away from the noise and distractions of everyday life; getting to a spot normaly involved a hike through the woods. This only added to the fun of fishing, blossoming my love for nature. Today, I get out whenever I can, and have learned to appreciate all the details of the outdoors and natural life.</p>

									<p>Below are some of the places I've visited recently, and some of my catches:</p>
