      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I spent my first few years of education at Amigos in Cambridge, moving to Acera, a private school in Winchester, in 4th grade. I've studied math outside of school for most of my life, and am now retaking AP Calculus BC at CRLS.

      <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
      <p>
        I play volleyball for both CRLS and a club team. This is the beginning of my second year playing volleyball, as I was a gymnast up to then. Outside of sports I love to go fishing, especially with my friends; spending time outside and at bodies of water is a big part of my life.
